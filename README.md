Sales Analysis

This Project contains:

1) Sales_Data of the year 2019
2) all_data.csv is created after concatinating all csv files
3) Sales_Analysis jupyter notebook

Steps Involved:

1)  Data Cleaning:  Tasks during this section include:

- Drop NaN values from DataFrame
- Removing rows based on a condition
- Change the type of columns (to_numeric, to_datetime, astype)

2) Data exploration : We explore 5 high level business questions related to our data:

- What was the best month for sales? How much was earned that month?
- What city sold the most product?
- What time should we display advertisemens to maximize the likelihood of customerâ€™s buying product?
- What products are most often sold together?
- What product sold the most? Why do you think it sold the most?

3) Used many different pandas & matplotlib methods. They include:

- Concatenating multiple csvs together to create a new DataFrame (pd.concat)
- Adding columns
- Parsing cells as strings to make new columns (.str)
- Using the .apply() method
- Using groupby to perform aggregate analysis
- Plotting bar charts and lines graphs to visualize our results
- Labeling our graphs
